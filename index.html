          <h3>Did you know?</h3>
          <p>
            Did you know that our kittens respond better to specific frequencies
            of sound? the ability to hear and recognize sounds is directly
            related to their predatory instinct. In nature, cats looks for small
            prey that make
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(50, 50, 50)"
              >short and high-pitched sounds</span
            >, such as mice and birds, and thatâ€™s the kind of sound they hear
            best and naturally pay attention to. that is why it is important to
            choose for your kitten a name with high pitched sounds, as it helps
            them to assimilate and respond better to your calls.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Did I choose my cat's name wrong?</h3>
          <p>
            Certainly not, there is no such thing as a bad name. If your
            kitten's name turn out to be low-pitched, you may have to change the
            way you call him. For example, if your cat's name is
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(50, 50, 50)">"Bob"</span>
            (a low-pitched name), you may have to change the way you pronounce
            it. Saying
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(50, 50, 50)"
              >"Bobby"</span
            >, as if you were talking to a baby, it will certainly help him to
            recognize his name.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Does my cat know its name?</h3>
          <p>
            Now it's time to find out if your kitten recognizes its own name.
            Say four random words, with the same length and intonation, with a
            10 second interval between them. Now say your kitten's real name,
            and if it move its ears or look up for you, it probably recognizes
            and resembles its own name.
