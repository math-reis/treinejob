          <h2>Did you know?</h2>
          <p>
            Did you know that our kittens respond better to specific frequencies
            of sound? The ability to hear and recognize sounds is directly
            related to their predatory instinct. In nature, cats looks for small
            prey that make
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: darkorange"
              >short and high-pitched sounds</span
            >, such as mice and birds, and thatâ€™s the kind of sound they hear
            best and naturally pay attention to. That is why it is important to
            choose for your kitten a name with high pitched sounds, as it helps
            them to assimilate and respond better to your calls.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Did I choose my cat's name wrong?</h2>
          <p>
            Certainly not, there is no such thing as a bad name. If your
            kitten's name turn out to be low-pitched, you may have to change the
            way you call him. For example, if your cat's name is "Bob" (a
            low-pitched name), you may have to change the way you pronounce it.
            Saying "Bobby", as if you were talking to a baby, it will certainly
            help him to recognize his name.
